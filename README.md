# Afwaj | Keep Pilgrims Safe
A crowd management service for Hajj companies & prevent pilgrims from getting lost

## What is Afwaj?
It is a service provided to the hajj companies. The company will be able to manage different groups and track these groups and their status. Each group leader will be given an app to track the pilgrims and prevent them from getting lost, these pilgrims will be tracked through beacons with each one of them or a mobile app.

## How it works?
For each **Hajj Group**, there are one or more **Guide**. Afwaj allows the Guides to detect if they lost a Pilgrim during the crowd via a `Transmitter` device. That device keep sending a signal to our App - Each Guide will have our App to track his/her group of pilgrims. If any of the pilgrims went out of the Group Guide's zone, the App will notify the Group Guide. At the same time, this allows the Hajj Companies to keep tracking their Groups in an efficient way wit
